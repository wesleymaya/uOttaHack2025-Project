      "I've updated the groceries amount to $350. Since there was no 'car repairs' item in your budget to begin with, I didn't need to make any changes there. As for adding a $600 TV, your new total would be $2450, which is still under your budget limit.",

You can start by categorizing your expenses into needs (like rent and utilities) and wants (like entertainment). Then, prioritize your needs and allocate your budget accordingly.
